But of course, she needs to be able to say her own shit, right? So I gave her a (admittedly pretty shitty) ai.  <br><Br>But her whole thing is finding rare sessions right? If she doens't do that, she's not the SessionFinderAuthorBot, she's just some random newsbot or some shit. So I decided her AI would be able to comment on all the rad sessions she's finding... <br><Br>Okay, long story short, I added the ability for her to say something about each session she finds (on the session finder page), and the version of her here can go to that page and comment on the sessions she finds there. I went to so much trouble to do that using only client side code, no server.  All for a barely noticeable kind of joke on a page most people probably ignore? Yes.")

If players have a sick frog, then the code checks their child session to see if the remaining living players can fit into it (max of 12 players in a session at a time). If so, they go on over.  Their child session is a real session that has it's own fate, and these alien players are disrupting that. When they join the session, it prints the ID out, so you could put that in a url to see how the sesion was supposed to go. Sometimes the alien players help, quite often they make things way worse. <Br><Br> These sessions are pretty rare, so I ALSO wrote the AuthorBot over there to look for rare sessions and report back.")
